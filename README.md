# WildLifeConservation

## Main Idea:
The main idea of this project is to show the negative impact humans have on the environment; specifically on wildlife and their ecosystems. This project will include visual represenations and data that highlight animal species that are currently at risk or already extinct. Along with the causes of their endangerment and extinctions.


## Data Pulling:
We pulled our data from an online resource called 'Our World Data' which got their data from the IUCN Red List, a foundation that focuses on the conservation of wildlife and that "keeps inventory" of endangered species. We first downloaded the data as a csv and created a CSV reader on out jupyter notebooks and from there began our data cleaning process.

## Data Cleaning:
Our data cleaning process seemed fairly simple. When we imported pandas and printed out our data frame we saw a lot of empty data or data the provided no real value. We also reassigned some data, we did this in order to help us with our visualizations and when we would create them. What we also did was break up our data into three different data frames so we can see the breakdown of specific species within subgroups such as terrestrial wildlife, aquatic wildlife, and plants.

Terrestrial Data Frame - we put animals that live on land but trying to keep integrity in our data and trying to avoid skewing numbers we added reptiles and amphibians becuase they are tecnically both terrestial and aquatic.

Aquatic Data Frame - we did the same thing with this data frame as we did with the terrestial data frame again to keep the numbers from being skewed.

Plant Data Frame - this showed the quantity of plants that are endangered among Ferns and Allies, Flowering Plants, and Gymnosperms

## Visualizations:
For our visualizations we used three different types. A pie chart, a stacked bar graph, and a bar graph.

Pie Chart - our pie chart showed us 

Stacked Bar Graph - the stacked bar graph gave us 

Bar Graph - our bar graph showed us the distribution of endangered species among the given data frame we depicted

## Story:
The goal of this project is to educate and inform people on the threats to wildlife caused by human activity; an issue that is still taking place and harming the world globally. Our objective is to help raise awareness and  let the public see the importance of wildlife conservation. All in all, we hope to motivate others to take action and protect the our wildlife since it plays a vital role in the natural environment.

So while we were cleaning the data we were noticing one thing predominantly. Plants by far had the highest number of endangered species but in specific Flowering Plants. Why is that? We wanted to take a deeper dive into why that could be the case. Now that we have the data to point us in a certain direction we started digging. Looking for sources that could potentially point us to the answer we were looking for.
